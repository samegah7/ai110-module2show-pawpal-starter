# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

Three core actions a user should be able to do:

1. Add a pet — enter basic info like name, species, and age to create a pet profile.
2. Schedule a walk — pick a pet, date, and time to add a walk to the calendar.
3. See today's tasks — view a simple list of everything scheduled for the day across all pets.

Main objects in the system:

Pet
- attributes: name, species, age
- methods: get_info()

Owner
- attributes: name, pets (list)
- methods: add_pet()

Task
- attributes: title, duration_minutes, priority (low/medium/high)
- methods: is_high_priority()

Scheduler
- attributes: owner, tasks (list), available_minutes
- methods: add_task(), generate_schedule(), explain_plan()

ScheduledPlan
- attributes: tasks in order, total time, date
- methods: display()

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
